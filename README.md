# Portfolio2023
 The challenge was to create a portfolio, using new React skills

# Current Status
Submitted for review
<br>
I have not worked on the porfolio enough to get a fully functioning react app. I will continue to work on the project as it will be important for my future career.

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
